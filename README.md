## 1. Movie Rating Prediction with Python 🎥

### Objective
Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors using regression techniques. The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

### Description
This project involves:
- Data analysis
- Pre-processing
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning modeling

It provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.

### Files and Folders
- **Dataset**: Historical movie data containing features like genre, director, and actors.
- **Python Code**: Scripts for data analysis, pre-processing, feature engineering, and model building.
- **Notebook**: Jupyter notebook containing the step-by-step process of building the movie rating prediction model.
